You should insert the numbers assigned to your student number in "hw7_numbers.pdf", into
the following data structures. In addition, you will insert the letters of your first name into
the following data structures below.

- Binary Search Tree
- AVL Tree
- Red Black Tree
- Min Heap
- Max Heap
- 2-3 Tree
- 2-3-4 Tree

You should clearly show every step of rotation, split, etc.
After the insertions are complete for numbers, you should remove first two and last two
numbers from data structures.
Do not remove any letters from the word.

## PS:

- If you have any questions about the hw, please send an email to ogoksu@gtu.edu.tr
- Do not write any non-English words into your hw!
- You will submit your hw to TA (Özgü Göksu, Room:109), your homework should be
    handwritten, no print outs, photocopies etc.

Good Luck!
